        "text=\"In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit in a different room until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects began to associate the context of their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed. Their brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their phones, not watching television, not staring at the clock—was the only action that happened in that room.\\n \\\n",
        "The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.\\n\\\n",
        " It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to bed early if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the living room without getting distracted if that’s where you always play video games. But when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.\\n\\\n",
        " Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.\\n\\\n",
        "  Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in the store.\\n\\\n",
        "  When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.” \\n\\\n",
        "   When I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often work from my couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very difficult to stop working. There was no clear division between the end of work time and the beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table my office or the space where I ate meals? Was the couch where I relaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the same place. A few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a separate room for my office. Suddenly, work was something that happened “in here” and personal life was something that happened “out there.” It was easier for me to turn off the professional side of my brain when there was a clear dividing line between work life and home life. Each room had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking. The office was for working. \\n\\\n",
        "   Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits— and the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why the versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness. You can use your phone for all sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful device. But when you can use your phone to do nearly anything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to be productive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social media, check email, and play video games whenever you open your phone. It’s a mishmash of cues.\\n\\\n",
        "   You may be thinking, “You don’t understand. I live in New York City. My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to play multiple roles.” Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home.\\n\\\n",
        "   To sum up, creating a clear distinction between environments and the habits associated with them can significantly improve your ability to build and maintain new habits. Whether it's changing your physical surroundings or rearranging your digital spaces, the key is to limit distractions and cues that may interfere with your goals. By deliberately separating contexts, you create a more conducive space for positive habit formation. Ultimately, the more you can associate each environment with a specific task or behavior, the easier it will be to stick to the habits you want to build and break free from the old ones.\\n\""

              "0  In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit in a different room until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects began to associate the context of their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed. Their brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their phones, not watching television, not staring at the clock—was the only action that happened in that room.   \n",

It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.   \n",
              "2      It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to bed early if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the living room without getting distracted if that’s where you always play video games. But when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to form without interruption.   \n",

One of the most effective ways to set yourself up for success is by designing your environment to support the behaviors you want to cultivate. Our surroundings—both physical and digital—serve as constant cues that influence our actions and mindset. By consciously shaping these cues, we can make it easier to slip into the right mental state for each activity, whether it’s work, relaxation, or rest. This can be especially challenging in a fast-paced or cluttered environment, but with some strategic planning, you can turn even limited space into a powerful tool for habit formation.</td>\n",

              "0  Creating new habits often feels like an uphill battle, especially when you're surrounded by distractions or competing routines. One of the most effective ways to set yourself up for success is by designing your environment to support the behaviors you want to cultivate. Our surroundings—both physical and digital—serve as constant cues that influence our actions and mindset. By consciously shaping these cues, we can make it easier to slip into the right mental state for each activity, whether it’s work, relaxation, or rest. This can be especially challenging in a fast-paced or cluttered environment, but with some strategic planning, you can turn even limited space into a powerful tool for habit formation.   \n",

Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes automatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.   \n",
              "2                                                                        By setting clear boundaries between your environments, both physical and digital, you make it easier for your brain to shift into the right mode for each task. This separation helps minimize distractions and encourages focus. When you're at your desk, your mind knows it's time to work, and when you're in your living room, your brain understands that it’s time to unwind. The more intentional you are about defining these spaces and their respective functions, the more naturally your habits will align with the environment you’ve created.

            "0  Creating new habits often feels like an uphill battle, especially when you're surrounded by distractions or competing routines. One of the most effective ways to set yourself up for success is by designing your environment to support the behaviors you want to cultivate. Our surroundings—both physical and digital—serve as constant cues that influence our actions and mindset. By consciously shaping these cues, we can make it easier to slip into the right mental state for each activity, whether it’s work, relaxation, or rest. This can be especially challenging in a fast-paced or cluttered environment, but with some strategic planning, you can turn even limited space into a powerful tool for habit formation.   \n",

Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes automatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.   \n",

This separation helps minimize distractions and encourages focus. When you're at your desk, your mind knows it's time to work, and when you're in your living room, your brain understands that it’s time to unwind. The more intentional you are about defining these spaces and their respective functions, the more naturally your habits will align with the environment you’ve created. Over time, this structure will help you build a routine that supports your productivity and well-being   \n",

It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.   \n",

            "0  Creating new habits often feels like an uphill battle, especially when you're surrounded by distractions or competing routines. One of the most effective ways to set yourself up for success is by designing your environment to support the behaviors you want to cultivate. Our surroundings—both physical and digital—serve as constant cues that influence our actions and mindset. By consciously shaping these cues, we can make it easier to slip into the right mental state for each activity, whether it’s work, relaxation, or rest. This can be especially challenging in a fast-paced or cluttered environment, but with some strategic planning, you can turn even limited space into a powerful tool for habit formation.   \n",

Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes automatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.   \n",

This separation helps minimize distractions and encourages focus. When you're at your desk, your mind knows it's time to work, and when you're in your living room, your brain understands that it’s time to unwind. The more intentional you are about defining these spaces and their respective functions, the more naturally your habits will align with the environment you’ve created. Over time, this structure will help you build a routine that supports your productivity and well-being   \n",

Over time, subjects began to associate the context of their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed.

            "6     When I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often work from my couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very difficult to stop working. There was no clear division between the end of work time and the beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table my office or the space where I ate meals? Was the couch where I relaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the same place. A few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a separate room for my office. Suddenly, work was something that happened “in here” and personal life was something that happened “out there.” It was easier for me to turn off the professional side of my brain when there was a clear dividing line between work life and home life. Each room had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking. The office was for working.    \n",

When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits— and the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why the versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness. You can use your phone for all sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful device. But when you can use your phone to do nearly anything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to be productive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social media, check email, and play video games whenever you open your phone. It’s a mishmash of cues.   \n",

I live in New York City. My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to play multiple roles.” Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home.   \n",

Whether it's changing your physical surroundings or rearranging your digital spaces, the key is to limit distractions and cues that may interfere with your goals. By deliberately separating contexts, you create a more conducive space for positive habit formation. Ultimately, the more you can associate each environment with a specific task or behavior, the easier it will be to stick to the habits you want to build and break free from the old ones.   \n",
