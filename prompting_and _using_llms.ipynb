Her grandmother had left it to her, a whisper of \"Keep it safe, Elara,\" echoing in her mind.  Elara didn't know why the old backpack was so important, but something about its worn charm whispered of hidden secrets. \n","\n","That night, she decided to test the backpack.  She slipped it on, the leather surprisingly warm against her skin. As she zipped it closed, a tingling sensation ran down her spine, and the world around her seemed to shimmer.  Elara gasped as she found herself in a bustling marketplace, vibrant with exotic colors and smells. \n","\n","A vendor with fiery red hair and eyes that shimmered like emeralds beckoned her forward. \"Welcome, child,\" he said, his voice as smooth as honey. \"You have come seeking the wonders of the world, haven't you?\"\n","\n","Elara stared at him, dumbfounded. \"I... I don't know what you mean,\" she stammered. \n","\n","\"This backpack, my dear,\" the vendor chuckled, \"it's no ordinary bag. It's a portal, a key to endless possibilities.\"\n","\n","He pointed to a stall overflowing with sparkling gemstones, shimmering fabrics, and exotic spices. \"Anything you desire, you can find within this marketplace. But remember, the world is a place of both beauty and danger. Choose wisely.\"\n","\n","Elara's heart pounded with excitement. She spent hours exploring the marketplace, buying a tapestry woven with moonbeams, a handful of shimmering silver coins, and a small vial of whispering perfume.  The vendor warned her to be careful, explaining that the magic of the backpack could be overwhelming if misused. \n","\n","Elara returned to her attic, the backpack a gateway to a world of wonder. She used it to visit ancient forests where trees whispered secrets, to meet talking animals, and to learn about cultures lost to time. She even met a young girl, trapped in a painting, who she helped escape into the world. \n","\n","But with every adventure, a shadow of unease grew within her.  The backpack was becoming a crutch, a way to escape reality.  She stopped seeing her friends, neglecting her studies, obsessed with the next adventure.  One day, she found herself in a dark and dangerous forest, the backpack suddenly empty, its magic gone. \n","\n","Fear gnawed at her.  She realized she had lost her way, her reliance on the backpack had robbed her of her own courage.  As she stumbled through the forest, trying to find her way back, a voice whispered in her ear, \"The world is waiting, Elara. But only you can unlock its true magic.\"\n","\n","It was her grandmother's voice.  She realized the backpack wasn't a crutch, but a tool.  She needed to learn to face the world, not escape it.  \n","\n","Elara made her way back to the attic, the backpack feeling lighter, less of a burden.  She put it back in the dusty corner, knowing that she would use it, but not rely on it. She understood now that the real magic wasn't in the backpack, but in her own heart, her own ability to dream and explore.  The backpack, a symbol of her journey, would always be there, a reminder of the wonders she had seen and the strength she had found within herself. \n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"S_WUshnOZhzy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["article_list=['''Can’t Get Enough Carbs? That Craving Might Have Started More Than 800,000 Years Ago\n","New research traces the genetic underpinnings of the enzyme amylase, which helps humans digest starches and sugars\n","Sarah Kuta\n","Daily Correspondent\n","October 18, 2024 3:18 p.m.\n","Chef cutting a loaf of bread with other loaves nearby\n","Scientists traced the history of AMY1, the gene that's responsible for the production of amylase, an enzyme that helps break down complex carbohydrates. Pixaby\n","From crispy French fries to crusty sourdough loaves, carbs are an integral (and delicious) part of the human diet.\n","\n","But why do we love these starchy and sugary foods? The answer might be embedded in our DNA, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.\n","Scientists have traced the genetic underpinnings of our ability to digest carbs to more than 800,000 years ago, long before the advent of agriculture—and much earlier than previously thought.\n","\n","This finding raises new questions around our hunter-gatherer ancestors’ diet and lifestyle. It also challenges the long-held belief that a protein-rich diet was responsible for the increase in human brain size, scientists suggest. Perhaps carbs, not meat, gave humans the energy needed for developing bigger brains.\n","“We know that dietary shifts have played a central role in human evolution … but reconstructing these events that took place thousands, hundreds of thousands and even millions of years ago is daunting,” says Christina Warinner, an anthropologist at Harvard University who was not involved with the research, to CNN’s Katie Hunt. “This study’s genomic sleuthing is helping to finally time stamp some of those major milestones, and it is revealing tantalizing clues about humanity’s long love affair with starch.”\n","\n","Researchers studied the genomes of 68 ancient humans, including one that lived 45,000 years ago. More specifically, they focused on a gene called AMY1, which is responsible for the production of an enzyme called amylase.\n","Mansion Global\n","Michael Jordan Scores a Buyer for His Chicago Megamansion After More Than a Decade\n","Sponsored By Mansion Global\n","\n","Amylase helps humans digest complex carbohydrates, starting from the moment a starchy food enters the mouth. Amylase, which is produced in the salivary glands and the pancreas, is also the reason why even non-sugary carbs like bread sometimes taste sweet.\n","\n","Today’s modern humans have varying numbers of amylase genes in their DNA—some people have as many as 11 AMY1 copies per chromosome. These copies seem to be specific to humans: Chimpanzees, for example, also produce amylase, but they only have a single copy of the gene.\n","\n","When the team looked at ancient human DNA, they found that hunter-gatherers already had four to eight copies of AMY1, on average, even though our species had not yet developed agriculture. Neanderthals and Denisovans, early human relatives, also had duplicate AMY1 genes.\n","\n","These findings indicate that copies of AMY1 may date back to a common ancestor some 800,000 years ago, before those three species split off from one another. But why did early humans—who primarily ate a carnivorous diet—have the amylase gene? Perhaps they were also eating starchy foods, in addition to meat. Or maybe the AMY1 genes developed randomly and served no purpose at all. Scientists still aren’t sure of the reason, reports NBC News’ Aria Bendix.\n","\n","Another recent study, published last month in the journal Nature, finds that the average number of AMY1 copies in human DNA has increased over the last 12,000 years—a timeline that corresponds with when humans began domesticating and growing crops, many of which were starchy grains and tubers.\n","\n","\n","This finding seems to suggest that having more copies of AMY1 gave farming humans some kind of advantage that helped boost their chance of survival. But scientists aren’t sure what that advantage might have been. One possibility is that amylase does more than just kickstart the digestion of carbs—maybe it also helps the human body extract more energy from carbs, which would have been useful during times of food scarcity.\n","\n","During a famine, for instance, producing more amylase may have been a “matter of life and death,” says Omer Gokcumen, a geneticist at the University at Buffalo and a co-author of the Science study, to the New York Times’ Carl Zimmer.''',''' Can Lynx Be Saved in the Balkans?\n","A small team of local scientists are fighting rapid industrialization, misinformation and more to save Europe’s iconic cat\n","\n","Taxidermied Balkan Lynx\n","Dime Melovski gestures at lynx displayed in a hunter’s lodge in North Macedonia. The hunters found the lynx dead on the road and asked the scientists for permission to taxidermy it. Emily Soreghan\n","Emily Soreghan\n","\n","I am in the back of a crowded jeep in late March. Outside, in the early Albanian spring, fat rain falls hard. A shepherd drives a sea of goats down the narrow road—they part around our car like a river around a stone. My goal is to see a Balkan lynx, but chances are slim.\n","\n","Lynx, Europe’s iconic medium-sized cat, are famously elusive. They are solitary and silent, traveling and hunting by night through high mountain forests. By the 1950s they were nearly exterminated on the continent. Today, through extensive conservation efforts, lynx are regaining territory. But in the Balkans, that trend is reversing. Only three remnant populations of the Balkan subspecies, Lynx lynx balcanicus, remain. After surviving the last ice age, the mass extirpation of large carnivores and countless wars, they are now critically endangered. Scientists estimate 20 to 39 individuals remain.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","In the front of the car, Bledi Hoxha, a biologist for the Tirana-based nonprofit Protection and Preservation of Natural Environment in Albania, pulls memory cards from his pockets. Biologist Dime Melovski of the nonprofit Macedonian Ecological Society opens his laptop. We spend the day hiking to remote camera traps and gathering them on behalf of the Balkan Lynx Recovery Program, a coalition fighting to protect the critically endangered lynx from extinction.\n","\n","I watch as the scientists review the memory cards. The first holds nothing: a few blank-eyed roe deer, a blurred boar, cattle, dogs. The next few are the same. Melovski sighs. He inserts the last. Shepherds, more deer and then: “A lynx!” Hoxha cries. The lynx is caught mid-stride, tawny coat and black spots illuminated by the flash. It looks affronted, like a startled house cat. Lynx have unique spot patterns, allowing the scientists to identify individuals. The scientists think this might be a new one, a sign of hope for the species in a region marked by devastating habitat loss.\n","\n","Balkan Lynx on Computer\n","Bledi Hoxha and members of his team the moment they discover a lynx caught on trail camera footage in the Valamara region of Albania Emily Soreghan\n","The missing lynx\n","In 1988, the Environment Conservation and Management Division of the Council of Europe commissioned the first-ever comprehensive assessment of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), which includes the Balkan subspecies. The cats were a topic of fervent discussion in countries like Switzerland, Germany and France, where, by the 1970s, they had gone extinct. Some biologists were eager to begin reintroduction efforts, but this required looking to places where lynx had not yet disappeared. How many were left? And where?\n","\n","Swiss biologists and husband-and-wife team Christine and Urs Breitenmoser rose to the task of compiling all known information about lynx in Europe. “It was clear, then, that the Balkan subspecies was highly threatened,” Urs says. But information was scarce. The subspecies was only mentioned by two scientists. The first, Ivan Buresh, “the patriarch of Bulgarian biology,” christened the subspecies Lyx lyx [sic] balcanicus in an obscure 1941 museum folio. He was basing his classification in part on a living individual obtained by the Imperial Zoological Garden in Sofia, Bulgaria, from what is today neighboring North Macedonia. Later, in the 1970s, a Serbian mammologist named Đorđe Mirić conducted a more thorough analysis of lynx skull specimens collected around the Balkans. Mirić’s efforts, published in German, introduced the isolated cat to the wider scientific community.\n","\n","\n","But by the time the Breitenmosers set about compiling their report, the two men were gone, as were the high days of Yugoslavian science. Based on questionnaires the Breitenmosers mailed to biologists across the Eurasian lynx range, Urs concluded the Balkan subspecies were likely isolated in the mountainous borders of then-Yugoslavia and Albania, northwest of Greece. But a formal study was needed. Basic questions about the Balkan cats remained unknown: Were they indeed a separate subspecies? Where, exactly, were they? How many remained? Did they hunt livestock? Answering these would require field studies and international cooperation.\n","\n","Unfortunately, this was the 1980s, and Albania had long been sealed from the world under communist dictator Enver Hoxha, whose death in 1985 would lead to a democratic transition early the following decade. “There was no way to get information in or out. No phone lines, not even mail,” says Urs. The Breitenmosers’ data for Albania was provided by an Albanian biologist who had escaped to Romania. But he was not a cat specialist and admitted his knowledge was neither accurate nor current. When Albania opened in 1991, the dissolution of neighboring Yugoslavia was well underway. Violence and ethnic tension, particularly in the mountainous border regions where the lynx were rumored to live, made fieldwork impossible. In 1998, the war in Kosovo erupted, and then an armed conflict in North Macedonia. Finally, in 2005, stakeholders met. The Balkan Lynx Recovery Program was born.\n","\n","Today, program partners include environmental nonprofits from each of the Balkan lynx range countries, including those represented by Bledi Hoxha and Dime Melovski. The team has isolated three lynx population hot spots: Munellë and the Valamara region, both in Albania, and Mavrovo National Park in North Macedonia. Since the recovery program began, Melovski and his team have been studying the lynx population in Mavrovo National Park intensely, conducting surveys, erecting camera traps and, most recently, capturing live lynx to track their movements with radio telemetry collars. Their methods have taken a few seasons to refine.\n","\n","“I would receive [an automatic] call at 2 a.m. and race to the trap,” Melovski says, a smile playing at the edge of his lips, “only to find a very scared dog.”\n","\n","The team in North Macedonia partnered with local engineering students to improve their traps. Each year they tinker with the design a little, in response to the season’s trials.\n","\n","Hunters and poachers\n","\n","Gauging public attitudes toward carnivores is crucial for their conservation. Rural residents, hunters and livestock breeders are often the first to be affected when predator territory expands. Public perceptions of carnivores have been extensively studied around the world, with conservationists trialing different ways to mitigate conflicts with stakeholders—from paying ranchers for animals lost to predation to using specialized guard dogs to protect herds.\n","\n","Accordingly, one of the Balkan Lynx Recovery Program’s first tasks was to conduct a baseline survey of locals. The scientists aimed to identify any potential conflicts between humans and lynx that would become an obstacle to their recovery in the region. When Melovski and his team reviewed the results, they encountered widely held fear. A common myth rumored that lynx wait in trees to attack humans from above. Most interviewees could not answer basic facts about the cat’s appearance.\n","\n","Thousands of acres of lynx habitat are owned and managed by hunting societies and livestock breeders, and this can lead to problems. If hunters don’t know lynx ecology, they are more likely to over-hunt lynx prey, like roe deer, hare and chamois. And if shepherds think lynx are a threat to their livestock, they are liable to kill them despite the moratorium.\n","\n","Melovski and his team realized protecting lynx in the region would require educating the people living in their habitats. They decided to partner with local hunters to live-trap the cats for telemetry collaring. Their hope is that by collaborating with hunters, they can both educate them on the importance of not over-harvesting and transform their love for wilderness into on-the-ground lynx advocacy. “What better way to cooperate with hunters than to hunt?” says Aleksandar Stojanov, another Macedonian Ecological Society biologist. “Trapping is a form of hunting. They really get into it.”\n","\n","\n","After the camera survey is complete, I accompany Melovski and Stojanov to disable one of these traps at a hunting society’s compound near Mavrovo.\n","\n","A member of the hunting group waits beside the trap, rain dripping from his neon orange hat. Melovski works quickly to disable the trap for mating season. The hunter excitedly demonstrates the features of his new cameras to the visiting scientists. When Melovski finishes disconnecting the trap’s trigger, the hunter beckons us to the compound for coffee. Inside the lodge, trophies of wild boar, roe deer, eagles and bears hang from plywood walls. The hunters greet the scientists like old friends, offering seats on antler-legged chairs.\n","\n","Balkan Lynx Box Trap\n","Melovski and Aleksandar Stojanov disable a live lynx trap in Mavrovo National Park. Emily Soreghan\n","According to a press release from Hoxha’s Albanian nonprofit, 14 cats have been killed since 2006. The poachers, according to the scientists I spoke to, are often city-dwellers who travel to lynx territory for leisure killing and trophy collecting. This differentiates them from local, licensed hunters, who kill deer, boar and other legal prey for meat. Although killing lynx is illegal in every range country, consequences are rare. In 2020, Hoxha’s environmental nonprofit received a tip about a taxidermy lynx displayed in a local restaurant. Pictures of the slain cat on the restaurant’s Facebook page matched the spot pattern of one the team photographed in Munellë. The team fought hard to get a case about the animal heard, but a court dismissed it.\n","\n","“We have nice laws here, sophisticated laws. But we don’t have justice. And those two things are separate,” says Fatos Lajçi, head of an environmental nonprofit in Kosovo called Environmentally Responsible Action. He routinely catches poachers on his cameras in Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park and submits them to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, where he says the cases sit unheard.\n","\n","\n","The researchers are frustrated by what they consider mismanagement at every level of government. According to Melovski, the governments care about national parks only for their value as tourist draws, not for their biodiversity.\n","\n","Fragmentation and loss of habitat\n","Researchers say the flurry of large construction projects in the region, combined with deeply rooted corruption and poor environmental oversight, is catastrophic for the fragile lynx population. “In these post-conflict areas, development overshadows environmental disaster,” Lajçi says. “And we suffer for it.”\n","\n","The problem is especially acute in Albania. This year, on February 22, the parliament quickly passed an amendment to the protected area law. It opens the door for development in national parks when a project is deemed of strategic importance.\n","\n","Aleksandër Trajçe, the executive director of Protection and Preservation of Natural Environment in Albania, looks strained on our short video call. I catch him in between a meeting about an airport the government is building in the Vjosa River delta and a meeting about a proposed solar power plant in lynx territory. “The infrastructure boom that happened elsewhere in Europe after the Second World War has come to the Balkans,” he says. “Everything you can imagine is being built. Power lines, dams, hydropower plants, wind farms, solar, airports, highways, railways … and all of that, of course, will have very serious effects on this already fragile population.”\n","\n","According to Vox News Albania, Minister of Tourism and Environment Mirela Kumbaro said the changes to the protected area law will only affect specific places designated for “elite tourist activities, ecotourism, agrotourism or high-level tourism, within the very strict criteria approved by the ministry and the National Territorial Council.”\n","\n","\n","But Hoxha doubts the legitimacy of impact assessments performed by the government. Albania is one of the most corrupt states in Europe, according to Transparency International, and locals feel it. When not planned carefully, development creates many problems for wildlife. Access roads cut for construction allow poachers who target lynx prey and loggers who destroy the cat’s habitat to penetrate deeper into previously remote terrain. They also sever bio-corridors between populations, and lynx are trapped in smaller and smaller pockets of functional ecosystems.\n","\n","Given their low population numbers, lynx are already in trouble genetically. Melovski suspects inbreeding among the small population, which has been suggested by recent studies. Gene flow among their three remaining hot spots is crucial for survival of the species, but it is increasingly dangerous for the cats to travel between mountain ranges. Lajçi believes one lynx, found dead in Kosovo in 2017, likely perished due to an arduous journey through prey-less, developed terrain while searching for a mate. He and his team are lobbying for better environmental protection, but progress is slow.\n","\n","Balkan Lynx Biologists and Hunters\n","Members of an Albanian hunting lodge exchange lynx pictures with scientists from the Macedonian Ecological Society. Emily Soreghan\n","Later in the evening I accompany Melovski and Stojanov to dinner with an Albanian hunting society. Ethnic Albanians in North Macedonia are a historically marginalized minority. Melovski and Stojanov don’t speak Albanian. The hunters don’t speak Macedonian. Nevertheless, the dinner lasts three hours, the men exchanging phones like proud fathers, comparing lynx photos. The hunters and the scientists have managed to find common ground in their love for this unique and threatened cat, a notoriously difficult task even without the additional gulf of ancient ethnic tension.\n","“It’s remarkable, the changes emanating from this partnership,” Melovski says. “On the local level, huge changes are occurring. Corruption hampers everything we try to achieve nationally, but the bottom-up approach gives us hope.”””\n","\n","Get the latest Science stories in your inbox.''','''Mud, beer and cash: Annual wife-carrying championship takes Maine by storm\n","The event is believed to be based on a 19th century Finnish legend involving a man whose gang was known to pillage villages and carry away the women.\n","\n","Sunday 13 October 2024 08:09, UK\n","\n","Annual wife-carrying championship takes place, with beer and cash up for grabs1:10\n","Play Video - Annual wife-carrying championship\n","Annual wife-carrying championship takes place\n","Why you can trust Sky News\n","While its origins are not exactly politically correct - more than 30 couples competed in the North American Wife Carrying Championship in front of cheering crowds.\n","\n","The event sees competitors splash through water, leap over logs and trudge through mud - all while carrying their partner like a sack of potatoes.\n","\n","Sponsored link\n","USA Welcomes Ghanaians for Work Visa\n","USA Welcomes Ghanaians for Work Visa\n","usavisaconsultant.com\n","What is Outbrain\n","It is believed to be based on a 19th century Finnish legend involving a man known as \"Ronkainen the Robber\", whose gang was known to pillage villages and carry away the women.\n","\n","Nic Vinsonhaler looses his footing while carrying Tara Rogowski.

But the 911 call they received recently from a woman being hounded by dozens of raccoons swarming her home near Poulsbo stood out.\n","\n","The woman reported having had to flee her property after 50 to 100 raccoons descended upon it and were acting aggressively, said Kevin McCarty, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office. She told deputies she started feeding a family of raccoons decades ago and it was fine until about six weeks earlier, when the number showing up went from a handful to around 100.\n","\n","“She said those raccoons were becoming increasingly more aggressive, demanding food, that they would hound her day and night — scratching at the outside of her home, at the door. If she pulled up her car, they would surround the car, scratch at the car, surround her if she went from her front door to her car or went outside at all,” McCarty said. “They saw this as a food source now, so they kept coming back to it and they kept expecting food.”\n","\n","\n","It was not clear what caused their numbers to balloon suddenly. Both the sheriff’s office and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife determined no laws were broken, McCarty said.\n","\n","“This is a nuisance problem kind of of her own making that she has to deal with,” he said. Video from the sheriff’s office shows raccoons milling around trees, and deputies who responded to the call observed 50 to 100 of them, he added.\n","\n","\n","Bridget Mire, a spokesperson with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, said by email that under state law it is illegal to feed large carnivores, such as bears or cougars. While municipalities or counties may have local statutes forbidding the feeding of other wildlife, it is currently not against state law to do so, she said.\n","\n","Regardless, the agency discourages people from feeding wildlife. Raccoons, for example, can carry diseases, and food can also attract predators such as coyotes and bears, according to Mire.\n","\n","Advertisement\n","\n","Mire said an agency wildlife conflict specialist has met with the woman, who has stopped feeding the critters.\n","\n","“The raccoons appear to have started dispersing now that they are no longer being fed, and we are glad for a positive outcome to this case,” Mire wrote.\n","\n","Poulsbo is about a 90-minute car and ferry ride northwest of Seattle.''','''Humpback whale 'scoops up and spits out lobster fisherman'\n","Man was diving for lobster off the coast of the northeastern state of Massachusetts when a whale 'tried to eat' him\n","\n","Campbell MacDiarmid\n","\n","\n","Michael Packard recovers in hospital\n","Michael Packard recovers in hospital Credit: CAPE COD TIMES\n","Cape Cod lobster diver Michael Packard returned to port in Provincetown on Friday with the big fish story of a lifetime.\n","\n","The commercial diver said he was collecting the clawed crustaceans at a depth of 45 feet when he was swallowed whole by a whale.\n","\n"," “All of a sudden I felt this huge bump, and everything went dark,” Mr Packard, 56, said following his release from Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis.\n","\n","Initially fearing he had been swallowed by a Great White shark, Mr Packard couldn’t feel any teeth or bite wounds.\n","\n","\"I realised, 'Oh, my God, I'm in a whale's mouth.

North London, in the near future. Picture the scene: guests enjoying a bowl of dinky heritage tomatoes.\n","\n","“Ooh are these?”\n","\n","“Not just dinky heritage tomatoes...yes they are from Marks & Spencer,” replies the hostess. The exchange segues into a conversation about supermarkets of choice. There is chit chat about the buoyant, nothing’s-too-much trouble atmosphere in Waitrose, Tesco prices and a little cheer goes up at the mention of Morrisons’ fresh fish counter. I can hold my peace no longer.\n","\n","“Well, I shop at Sainsbury’s because I enjoy the soullessness, the no-man’s-land sense of isolation when you’re trying to find someone – anyone – on the shop floor to help you find the capers and all that’s available is a touchscreen pad.\n","\n","“Oh yes, and the existential Fritz Lang alienation of vast self service checkouts devoid of all human contact, where you have to cosplay a Sainsbury employee by manning the conveyor belt yourself, scanning everything yourself and packing everything yourself. And after all that, you join the mob of frustrated shoppers, waiting and waiting for an actual member of staff (Oh I just spotted one! Quick! She went that-away!) to declare you are over 25 so you can flee the building, go home and crack open a bottle to alleviate the stress.”\n","\n","And as a stunned silence falls upon the table, I wait a beat before adding: “Of course not!\n","\n","Once Sainsbury’s sacked its staff and replaced them with ‘devices’ I refused to set foot in the place. I’m a living, breathing shopper, not an inanimate end user.”\n","\n","Unfortunately, this vision of retail hell may not be nearly as remote as it sounds, given the supermarket aims to slash £1billion in costs – on top of the £1.3 billion it already cut from 2021 to March 2024. Stores are being refurbished, too, so it’s the people – around 1,500 of them across all parts of the business – that are facing the axe.\n","\n","Before this Government starts yacking on about the evils of capitalism, it should be pointed out that its Employment Rights Bill, with its sweeping reforms and radical overhaul of workers’ rights, has put off a majority of bosses from taking on staff. Some 57 per cent of executives surveyed by the Institute of Directors admitted they were “less likely to hire” as a result of changes. For supermarkets, banning “exploitative zero hours contracts” certainly puts paid to the give-and-take that has always suited casual (but vital) employees such as parents juggling families or students.\n","\n","In fact, jobs with zero hours contracts actually attract 25 per cent more applicants than equivalent permanent roles, according to research from the London School of Economics. Academics there have found workers on zero-hours contracts had “a very strong preference” for their set-up and were “willing to forgo some salary for the flexibility their contract offers”. Hardly exploitation, then.\n","\n","On the contrary, I’d say it’s far more exploitative to have me, the customer, doing all the legwork every time I swing by for my monthly shop. When I’m handing over several hundred quid at the till, is it so very unreasonable to hope I might get a cheery greeting, a quip about my serious chilli jam habit or even just a smile? We’ll all be shopping in silence if some supermarkets have their way.\n","\n","Then again, Asda is about to swap some of its self checkouts back to staffed ones, due to customer demand. Morrisons has admitted it went “a bit too far” in its enthusiasm for self checkouts and is now conducting a u-turn. And the upmarket grocer Booths removed all its self checkouts last year specifically in order to improve customer service. I’d like to think Sainsbury’s might be persuaded to do a reverse ferret. I’ve shopped there for decades and I’d hope to continue, but not if I’m made to feel like a bewildered extra in The Matrix, lost forever in a mechanised dystopia when all I came in for was a jar of capers. ''',\n","              '''Chris Van Tulleken\n","This is how I’d solve the obesity crisis\n","Harmful foods lack clear warnings. We need an overhaul on how we label food in this country\n","\n","Chris Van Tulleken\n","\n","\n","490\n","Dr Chris van Tulleken\n","In this country, we have no clear warnings on the foods that we know lead to weight gain, says Van Tulleken Credit: BBC\n","There is no perfect definition of healthy or unhealthy food. There is no perfect system of regulation. But I believe that proper labelling and a commitment from the Government to protect our wellbeing is the minimum we should expect.\n","\n","This autumn, the Food and Drug Administration is considering introducing food warning labels to flag products’ salt, sugar and fat content to consumers for the first time.\n","\n","Yet, weirdly, on this side of the Atlantic, where more than half of us live with excess weight we have no clear warnings on the foods that we know lead to weight gain as well as myriad other problems.\n","\n","Instead we have two official ways that describe unhealthy food, traffic lights and a term called HFSS: high fat, sugar, salt.\n","\n","These two systems are inconsistent with each other and neither one has been shown to be effective. In fact in almost every way our national diet and health has worsened so that we have some of the worst rates of diet-related diseases of any equivalent country.\n","\n","Since their introduction over a decade ago, we have seen an increase in death and suffering, with child obesity in particular.\n","\n","It’s clear that we need to do things differently. Here’s what I would suggest.\n","\n","1. Replace voluntary traffic lights with mandatory black octagonal stop signs\n","Our traffic light warnings, which were introduced in 2013 and are voluntary, make no sense; nobody knows what to do at a traffic light showing different colours. Likewise if a product shows differently-coloured labels, is it a healthy or unhealthy food?\n","\n","Take an M&S ready-meal lasagne, which has red labels for saturated fat (a huge 76 per cent of our daily recommended allowance) and salt (49 per cent), but a green one for sugar (in spite of containing 11.6g). How can consumers be expected to make a good decision?\n","\n","In the UK we should have stop signs for foods with high levels of calories, salt, saturated fat and sugar. This would mean the lasagne would get three stop signs, which might make you think twice before eating two portions (as I typically do).\n","\n","UK food labelling system\n","‘Nobody knows what to do at a traffic light showing different colours’ says Van Tulleken of the British food labelling system, above Credit: Stephen Frost / Alamy Stock Photo\n","Mexican food label\n","Instead, we should adopt a South America-style system, as above. The labels state: ‘excess calories’, ‘excess sugars’ and ‘excess saturated fats’\n","I’d suggest we bring in a South American-style system. Across Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Uruguay, Argentina and Colombia, there are no traffic lights, just black octagons with simple messages, like ‘high in sodium’, or ‘high in calories’. There is evidence to show this works: one Chilean study showed that between 2015 and 2017, there was a reduction of at least a quarter of high salt and sugar foods being purchased as a result of these labels.\n","\n","People argue that warning labels impact consumer freedoms, but this is simply not true. They help people make choices, which is what the vast majority of us want to do.\n","\n","2. Encourage reformulation\n","There is no reason why companies can’t reformulate existing products so that they’re better for us, and studies in South America have shown that this really works, as the idea of having their products covered in warning labels incentivises companies to create foods that are better for our health.\n","\n","Two years after they were introduced in Peru, the prevalence of beverages that needed a warning label dropped by 28 per cent, with 20 per cent fewer foods requiring such signs. There’s no reason this wouldn’t happen here too, and the potential impact on our health could be vast.\n","\n","3. Products with warning labels shouldn’t be sold to children\n","Any pre-prepared packaged food which has excessive calories, salt, sugar or saturated fat should not be marketed or sold to children. They should not have cartoon characters or be sold in schools, and they should have no health claims on the packet.\n","\n","At the moment the most harmful products don’t just lack clear warnings, they are often covered in health claims. Coco Pops – which have over a sixth of your daily added sugar intake, yet an amber traffic light on the box – make claims that they support healthy bones and are a source of fibre. This simply shouldn’t be allowed.\n","\n","4. Get rid of regulation loopholes\n","The HFSS designation fails to label many products which are ultra-processed, and most importantly, it’s not even applied to certain categories of food.\n","\n","Bread can be among the worst offenders for hidden sugar and salt. Last year, a study from Action on Salt showed that 75 per cent of sliced loaves contain at least as much salt per slice as a packet of ready salted crisps.\n","\n","But there are lots of oddities about the way we regulate food that are very, very inconsistent which means bread, no matter how high its levels of fat, sugar and salt, can’t be considered as HFSS. Why?\n","\n","Sliced bread is often made with emulsifiers, fats and flavourings, created to be extremely soft so, like the vast majority of ultra-processed foods, it can be consumed quickly. There’s also evidence to show that this can trigger inflammation and alter the microbiome, which is important for health.\n","\n","We should ditch HFSS and simply use our national guidance for calories, fat, salt and sugar to label and regulate food. Products ranking poorly in all four categories should be taxed, with the money ringfenced to subsidise real food.''','''How Labour’s ‘lazy’ inheritance tax grab will only punish middle-class families\n","Little revenue would be raised in a raid the super-wealthy could still avoid\n","\n","Mattie Brignal\n","Senior Money Reporter\n","\n","\n","281\n","rachel reeves\n","Chancellor Rachel Reeves is said to be looking at ways to alter IHT Credit: Joseph Foley/DCMS\n","\n","Rachel Reeves’s “politically motivated” inheritance tax grab will punish the middle classes while raising little revenue, wealth advisers have warned.\n","\n","The Chancellor is reportedly considering a string of changes to the death duty, as part of a scramble to raise as much as £35bn in this month’s Budget.\n","\n","Inheritance tax (IHT) is typically charged at 40pc on assets above a £325,000 threshold when a person dies.\n","\n","Ms Reeves is said to be looking at several ways to alter the levy, including raising the headline rate, cutting the level at which tax becomes payable, and tweaking exemptions and reliefs.\n","\n","However, experts have said the “lazy tax grab” would drag average families into paying the levy while the ultra-rich manipulate loopholes to avoid it.\n","\n","Tim Stovold, of accountancy firm Moore Kingston Smith, said: “Inheritance tax is a desperately unpopular tax. It’s not well-directed.\n","\n","“It’s paid by middle class people with expensive property who live in the South East. But the super-wealthy who can afford armies of wealth advisers can wrap up assets in trusts.\n","\n","“It will probably be politically motivated rather than a revenue raiser. Labour may choose, for example, to apply a 50pc levy on larger estates, but people with this level of wealth will plan around it.\n","\n","“In terms of raising revenue, it’s almost a rounding error. Even squeezing the pips with substantial reform won’t raise much more.”\n","\n","\n","At 40pc, Britain already has the highest inheritance tax rate in Europe. The levy raises around £7bn for the Exchequer. Around 4pc of deaths result in an inheritance tax bill.\n","\n","The Government’s own figures show that increasing the headline rate by one percentage point would raise just £80m in 2025-26. By comparison, raising income tax by the same amount would net the Treasury £6.2bn.\n","\n","The average UK house price is now £293,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. In England, this increases to £310,000 – just shy of the inheritance tax threshold.\n","\n","\n","It means ordinary families are increasingly at risk of being dragged into paying the levy – especially if Labour lowers the thresholds at which it is paid.\n","\n","Rachael Griffin, of wealth manager Quilter, said: “Inheritance tax was intended to target the wealthiest estates, not the average family home.\n","\n","“Simply lowering the IHT threshold, without addressing the wider complexities of inheritance tax, would be lazy policymaking.\n","\n","“It would be nothing more than a tax grab that would have far-reaching consequences, pushing more families into a tax that should only apply to the truly wealthy.”\n","\n","Ms Reeves is understood to be planning the biggest tax raid in history in her Budget, which is to be held on October 30.\n","\n","Labour could choose to amend a rule which allows money to be passed on tax-free if it is given away at least seven years before someone dies. It could also alter rules that exempt businesses and farmland from the tax.\n","\n","The Chancellor is also widely expected to raise capital gains tax and employers’ National Insurance contributions.\n","\n","The Treasury was approached for comment.\n","\n","''','''MG Cyberster review: the first electric sports car lives up to the firm’s illustrious history\n","This EV is also Chinese-owned MG’s first roadster this century.

With 20bhp at 4,000rpm, this tiny, 508kg tiddler could reach the heady speed of 64mph, deliver 40mpg and cost £175 at launch. It was spectacularly good value for the time, but these days taller drivers look ridiculous in them as they peer over the top of the windscreen.\n","\n","With a weight of 1,985kg, an output from its twin electric motors of 503bhp/535lb ft and a top speed of 125mph, you’d have thought there wasn’t much in common between the new MG Cyberster GT two-seater and an M-Type apart from the fact that the former has been built to celebrate the latter.\n","\n","But there is and it’s the seating position. In new as in old, you sit so high in the Cyberster that the top rail of the windscreen obscures your views in uphill corners, while at traffic lights you have to perform contortions to check when red turns to green. While it’s inevitable that a battery in the floor will increase the seat height, there seem to be at least a couple of inches of space under the powered seat. While MG says it prioritised seat height, you have to wonder how much lower they could have been mounted without electrical adjustment.\n","\n","For all of that, however, this is a terrific styling job for the Chinese-owned firm, with a sleek if derivative design, which mostly hides its height and bulk (it’s half a metre longer than the standard-setter in two-seat sports cars, Mazda’s MX-5, though about the same size as the BMW Z4 and Porsche Boxster rivals from Germany).\n","\n","The Cyberster started life more than five years ago as a concept car born out of a passion project from the design offices in London’s Marylebone to see what a successor to the MGB would look like (it’s much better than that). The project was rejected several times, but eventually the bosses at MG’s owner SAIC decided they would need more than just a series of cheap family SUVs if they were to define a market status above that of the common herd of Chinese rivals now charging over the horizon.\n","\n","The Cyberster has a top speed of 125mph: almost double that of the original 1928 M-Type Midget\n","The Cyberster has a top speed of 125mph: almost double that of the original 1928 M-Type Midget\n","The nitty gritty\n","It’s 4,535mm long and 2,110mm wide including the mirrors, with a 2,690mm wheelbase. It weighs a couple of tons, runs on 20-inch wheels and tyres (the cheaper rear-wheel-drive Trophy model has 19in rims), isn’t plated to tow anything and is warrantied for seven years and 80,000 miles.\n","\n","The battery is a lithium-ion NMC unit with 77kWh peak capacity, 74.4kWh of it usable. With 335bhp and 350lb ft, the £55,000 Trophy is capable of 121mph and 0-62mph in 5sec, with a 316-mile range.\n","\n","The twin-motor, all-wheel-drive GT has stronger performance (125mph, 3.2sec) and a 276-mile range. Both versions will charge at a maximum of 144kw on a DC fast charger and 7kW on a household wallbox. Charging takes 38 minutes with a 150kW charger from 10 to 80 per cent, 61min for the same charge with a 50kW charger and 10.5 hours for a full charge on a wallbox.\n","\n","The motorised scissor doors are an unnecessary affectation, however. They might look good, but they’re painfully slow to open and shut. Even on a Lamborghini, the scissor doors are manual devices balanced and virtually self-opening thanks to pressurised struts. The Cyberster’s doors aren’t particularly easy to power shut when outside the car, the key fob doesn’t always work, the doors don’t always respond fully, stopping half way open. On occasion, if you squeeze this wide car into a parking space, the opening doors risk brushing the car alongside. In one case I had to crawl under the quarter-open doors and squeeze inside, which wasn’t the most dignified of entries.\n","\n","The motorised scissor doors are painfully slow to open and shut\n","Style over substance: the motorised scissor doors are painfully slow to open and shut\n","By contrast the powered hood is watertight, smart, well insulated and furls and unfurls quickly and without fuss.\n","\n","Step inside\n","Given the car’s dimensions, the cockpit is small, though there’s enough rearward seat adjustment for taller drivers. The three-panel facia is angled round the driver, not all of it visible unless you like having the steering wheel in your lap. There’s a netted space behind the seats, but it’s narrow and not easy to get to. Expect to find things going missing under the seats.\n","\n","The boot is large but shallow and only 249 litres in capacity. You’ll get a formal suitcase in there, but not one of those huge North Face barrel bags. Under the bonnet is a huge plastic panel with detachable sections to access vital fluids and the fusebox. Home maintenance is not encouraged…\n","\n","There’s a lot of information displayed on the screens, almost too much, while the use of blue lighting means the tiny main-beam warning is easy to overlook. Do you really need the weather read out to you when you start the car? Discuss. But despite the calming influence of the UK engineers in the amount of animation on the dashboard, there’s a lot of spurious showing off, such as the burning tyres logo as you select Sport. And the audible school warning seems to be based on possibility rather than certainty, often yelling “School” when there isn’t one. And, like most modern cars, there’s a succession of warning bings and bongs whose meanings aren’t immediately apparent.\n","\n","The cockpit, with the facia angled round the driver, is small\n","The cockpit, with the facia angled round the driver, is small\n","On the road\n","With so much power on tap, you might be pleased to learn that the output is carefully staged and only comes on full and strong if you press the red steering-wheel button or use the right-hand shift paddle, which progressively ups the performance. The left one increases the amount of regenerative braking, while there is also a one-pedal operation available.\n","\n","Is it fast? Of course, but the accelerator is progressive and intuitive, a sign of careful calibration. There’s also one of the nicest artificial noises in the sporting modes, a gentle growl that could just be a combustion engine, but it never intrudes. Other EV makers please take note.\n","\n","With all independent suspension (twin wishbones at the front, a multi-link system at the back), the ride and handling starts from a good place. At gentle cruising speeds the GT has a firm, supple ride quality, though the spring and damper rates increase markedly if the wheel movement increases on, say, an undulating country road.\n","\n","The steering feels numb but direct and precise, so while it’s easy to place the nose into a bend, there’s not much indication of what’s going on at the tyres.\n","\n","Speed up, as the drivetrain will more than invite you to, and the handling starts to suffer. There’s still that extraordinary turn-and-follow feel of electric cars, where you find yourself relying on the grip of the tyres rather than any innate knowledge of the road surface. Body roll is kept in check and apart from the inert and unresponsive brake pedal, it all bodes well for a drop of sporting motoring…\n","\n","'You find yourself relying on the grip of the tyres rather than any innate knowledge of the road surface'\n","‘You find yourself relying on the grip of the tyres rather than any innate knowledge of the road surface’\n","And it is at this point you discover this car’s Achilles’ heel; bumps. On a typical undulating B-road, the Cyberster GT’s 20-inch wheels run out of travel so fast the ride feels like a tea tray pulled down a hill by an express train. The car pitches from front to rear and diagonally across the bodyshell. It heaves off the top of bumps so hard you seriously wonder about the placement of your inner organs. Road grip vanishes and returns depending on which wheels are unloaded, while the traction control systems are working virtually the whole time.\n","\n","Nor were these unfamiliar roads, this was a regular route over which rivals (combustion or electric) coped at similar speeds and cornering forces.\n","\n","As far as efficiency is concerned the Cyberster acquitted itself well, delivering 3.3 miles per kWh against the WLTP figure of 3.7m/kWh, which equates to a tested range of 238 miles against the claim of 276 miles. A word of warning, however. On the one motorway section during the test, the efficiency fell to 2.8m/kWh, so on a long fast journey you’d be lucky to see more than 200 miles of range, which realistically means you’d be looking for a charger after 150 miles.\n","\n","And this was in the summer, when the energy-depleting heater wasn’t in use. And using the latest figures for electricity generation in the UK, the well-to-wheels CO2 equivalent emissions is about 35.5g/km.\n","\n","The Telegraph verdict\n","Before you dismiss this car as merely a cynical Chinese attempt to emulate the great days of the British motor industry, I’d ask you to address a couple of facts. First, MG owner SAIC has not only indulged its designers in a way that European giants such as Stellantis or Volkswagen simply have not in recent years, it has also tried (and in many aspects succeeded in) building a sports car which lives up to the history of the company. In the process, it also beat the might of legacy car-makers to market with the novel concept of an electric sports car.\n","\n","It looks good, it drives reasonably well (as long as you don’t push too hard), and at sensible speeds on A- and B-roads the efficiency is fairly respectable. I’d prefer to buy a nimble Mazda MX-5 while I can, but in the world of EV motoring the MG not only is the sole drophead sports car, it’s also a half decent drophead sports car.\n","\n","The facts\n","On test: MG Cyberster GT 4x4\n","\n","Body style: two-door, two-seat sports car\n","\n","On sale: now\n","\n","How much?

1\n","A new study suggests that humans' love for carbs could be traced back to our ancestors more than 800,000 years ago, long before the advent of agriculture.\n","The study focused on the AMY1 gene, responsible for producing amylase, an enzyme that breaks down complex carbohydrates.\n","Researchers discovered that hunter-gatherers already possessed multiple copies of the AMY1 gene, indicating that early humans might have consumed starchy foods alongside their carnivorous diet.\n","This finding challenges the belief that a protein-rich diet was solely responsible for human brain development and suggests that carbohydrates might have played a significant role.\n","The study raises questions about the dietary habits of our ancient ancestors and highlights the importance of carbohydrates in human evolution. \n","\n","Article Summary 2\n","The Balkan lynx, a critically endangered subspecies of the Eurasian lynx, faces an uncertain future due to habitat loss and human conflict.\n","Only three remnant populations are left, totaling around 20-39 individuals, making them the most threatened lynx subspecies in the world.\n","Scientists are working to protect the lynx through the Balkan Lynx Recovery Program, which includes monitoring their populations, educating locals about the importance of conservation, and working with hunters to reduce conflicts.\n","However, the recovery program faces challenges from a rapidly industrializing region with weak environmental regulations, poaching, and the lack of legal protection for lynx.\n","Despite these challenges, the scientists are hopeful that by collaborating with local communities and building trust, they can create a future where the Balkan lynx can thrive once again. \n","\n","Article Summary 3\n","The annual North American Wife Carrying Championship took place in Maine, with over 30 couples competing for beer and cash prizes. \n","The event, inspired by a Finnish legend involving a robber who stole women, requires couples to race through mud, water, and obstacles while carrying their partner.\n","While the event traditionally involved a man carrying a woman, competitors this year were not required to be married or of a specific gender.\n","Participants often use a technique where the \"wife\" is carried upside down like a backpack, allowing for maximum agility during the race.\n","The winning couple receives a prize of the \"wife's\" weight in beer and five times that amount in cash, determined by weighing the \"wife\" on a scale. \n","\n","Article Summary 4\n","A 31-year-long treasure hunt for a golden owl, based on a book of riddles published in 1993, has come to an end. \n","The hunt involved 12 intricate puzzles that led treasure hunters to search for a replica owl token that could be exchanged for a golden equivalent. \n","This week, the replica was reportedly unearthed, ending the long-running quest. \n","The hunt had garnered a dedicated following of over 200,000 players, who spent years searching for the prize. \n","The winner, who remains anonymous, is now in possession of the replica, which will be exchanged for the golden owl worth an estimated €150,000. \n","\n","Article Summary 5\n","A woman in Washington state called 911 after being harassed by up to 100 raccoons that had descended on her property.\n","She had been feeding a family of raccoons for decades, but their numbers ballooned to over 100 in recent weeks.\n","The raccoons became increasingly aggressive, demanding food and hounding her both day and night.\n","While it is not illegal in Washington state to feed raccoons, wildlife officials discourage it as it can attract predators and spread diseases.\n","The woman stopped feeding the raccoons, and the number of raccoons has since started to decrease. \n","\n","Article Summary 6\n","A lobster diver, Michael Packard, was swallowed whole by a humpback whale off the coast of Massachusetts. \n","Packard, who was diving for lobsters at a depth of 45 feet, initially feared he had been attacked by a great white shark but quickly realized he was in the whale's mouth. \n","He was trapped inside the whale's mouth for approximately 30 to 40 seconds, experiencing pressure and movement as the whale swam and shook its head.\n","The whale eventually released Packard, likely mistaking him for prey, and the diver was rushed to shore by his crewmate.\n","Marine experts believe the whale was a confused juvenile that accidentally scooped up Packard during a feeding lunge, as humpbacks typically feed on krill and small fish and their esophaguses are too narrow to swallow a human. \n","\n","Article Summary 7\n","Supermarkets are increasingly relying on self-checkout systems, shifting the burden of labor onto customers. \n","This trend, exemplified by Sainsbury's, is driven by a desire to cut costs and eliminate human staff. \n","The author argues that this shift is exploitative, as customers are expected to perform tasks that were previously handled by employees. \n","While some supermarkets are reversing course due to customer feedback, the author expresses concern that this trend will continue. \n","She believes that the growing reliance on self-service will result in a soulless shopping experience devoid of human interaction. \n","\n","Article Summary 8\n","Chris Van Tulleken, a doctor, proposes a solution to the obesity crisis in the UK. \n","He argues that the current food labeling system is ineffective and instead advocates for a mandatory warning system using black octagonal stop signs for foods high in calories, salt, saturated fat, and sugar.\n","This system, inspired by South American models, has demonstrated success in reducing the consumption of unhealthy foods.\n","He also suggests encouraging companies to reformulate their products to be healthier and prohibiting the sale of unhealthy pre-prepared foods to children.\n","Finally, Van Tulleken calls for a revision of current regulations to eliminate loopholes and consistently apply warning labels to all ultra-processed foods, including bread, which often contains high levels of sugar and salt. \n","\n","Article Summary 9\n","Labour’s proposed inheritance tax changes are likely to disproportionately impact middle-class families while raising little revenue.\n","Experts warn that the “lazy tax grab” will push average families into paying the tax, while the ultra-wealthy can easily avoid it through loopholes.\n","Increasing the inheritance tax rate would only raise a small amount of revenue compared to other tax increases.\n","Lowering the threshold for inheritance tax would further target average families who are increasingly at risk of paying the levy due to rising house prices.\n","Wealth advisors believe Labour's proposed changes are a politically motivated attempt to raise revenue without addressing the complexities of inheritance tax. \n","\n","Article Summary 10\n","The MG Cyberster is a new electric sports car from the Chinese-owned MG brand.\n","The car is designed to celebrate the history of MG sports cars, specifically the 1928 M-Type Midget.\n","The Cyberster's sleek design is derivative but hides its height and bulk effectively.\n","The car's performance is impressive, with a top speed of 125mph and a 0-62mph time of 3.2 seconds.\n","However, the car's ride quality is severely compromised by its stiff suspension, which makes it unsuitable for rough roads.
